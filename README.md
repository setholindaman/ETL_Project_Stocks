ETL Project - Stocks

Finding Data

Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:

Stock data from yahoo.com
ETF data from yahoo.com


Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:


We extracted data from yahoo.com
We transformed the data in jupyter notebook with new data types, column headers, and only used stocks with a market cap of over 100 billion.
We then loaded our data into a relational MySQL database.


Project Report

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:


Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
